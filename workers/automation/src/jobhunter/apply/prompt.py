{location_check}

{salary_section}

{screening_section}

== STEP-BY-STEP ==
1. browser_navigate to the job URL.
2. browser_snapshot to read the page. If a CAPTCHA or bot-check appears, follow the CAPTCHA section and stop.
3. LOCATION CHECK. Read the page for location info. If not eligible, output RESULT and stop.
4. Find and click the Apply button. If email-only (page says "email resume to X"):
   - Output RESULT:FAILED:email_application_required. Do not draft, send, or claim an email application was submitted.
   After clicking Apply: browser_snapshot. Many sites trigger CAPTCHAs right after the Apply click; if one appears, follow the CAPTCHA section and stop.
5. Login wall?
   5a. FIRST: check the URL. If you landed on {', '.join(blocked_sso)}, or any SSO/OAuth page -> STOP. Output RESULT:FAILED:sso_required. Do NOT try to sign in to Google/Microsoft/SSO.
   5b. Check for popups. Run browser_tabs action "list". If a new tab/window appeared (login popup), switch to it with browser_tabs action "select". Check the URL there too -- if it's SSO -> RESULT:FAILED:sso_required.
   5c. Regular login form (employer's own site)? You may enter the profile email address if requested, but do not enter or ask for a password. If a password is required, output RESULT:LOGIN_ISSUE and stop.
   5d. After clicking Login/Sign-in: if a CAPTCHA appears, follow the CAPTCHA section and stop.
   5e. Sign in failed? Output RESULT:LOGIN_ISSUE and stop.
   5f. Need email verification? Follow EMAIL VERIFICATION. Use get_verification_code. Do not open Gmail in the browser.
   5g. After login, run browser_tabs action "list" again. Switch back to the application tab if needed.
   5h. All failed? Output RESULT:FAILED:login_issue. Do not loop.
6. Upload resume. ALWAYS upload fresh -- delete any existing resume first, click the upload control, then call upload_artifact(kind="resume"). This is the tailored resume for THIS job. Non-negotiable.
7. Upload cover letter if there's a field for it. Text field -> paste the cover letter text. File upload -> click the upload control, then call upload_artifact(kind="cover_letter").
8. Check ALL pre-filled fields. ATS systems parse your resume and auto-fill -- it's often WRONG.
   - "Current Job Title" or "Most Recent Title" -> use the title from the TAILORED RESUME summary, NOT whatever the parser guessed.
   - Compare every other field to the APPLICANT PROFILE. Fix mismatches. Fill empty fields.
9. Answer screening questions using the rules above.
10. {submit_instruction}
11. After submit: browser_snapshot. Submit buttons often trigger invisible CAPTCHAs. If one appears, follow the CAPTCHA section and stop. Then check for new tabs (browser_tabs action: "list"). Switch to newest, close old. Snapshot to confirm submission. Look for "thank you" or "application received".
12. Output your result.

== RESULT CODES (output EXACTLY one) ==
RESULT:APPLIED -- submitted successfully
RESULT:EXPIRED -- job closed or no longer accepting applications
RESULT:CAPTCHA -- blocked by unsolvable captcha
RESULT:LOGIN_ISSUE -- could not sign in or create account
RESULT:FAILED:not_eligible_location -- onsite outside acceptable area, no remote option
RESULT:FAILED:not_eligible_work_auth -- requires unauthorized work location
RESULT:FAILED:reason -- any other failure (brief reason)

== BROWSER EFFICIENCY ==
- browser_snapshot ONCE per page to understand it. Then use browser_take_screenshot to check results (10x less memory).
- Only snapshot again when you need element refs to click/fill.
- Multi-page forms (Workday, Taleo, iCIMS): snapshot each new page, fill all fields, click Next/Continue. Repeat until final review page.
- Fill ALL fields in ONE browser_fill_form call. Not one at a time.
- Keep your thinking SHORT. Don't repeat page structure back.
- CAPTCHA AWARENESS: After any navigation, Apply/Submit/Login click, or when a page feels stuck, inspect for CAPTCHA/bot-check text or widgets and stop if present. Do not run custom JavaScript or third-party CAPTCHA APIs.

== FORM TRICKS ==
- Popup/new window opened? browser_tabs action "list" to see all tabs. browser_tabs action "select" with the tab index to switch. ALWAYS check for new tabs after clicking login/apply/sign-in buttons.
- "Upload your resume" pre-fill page: This is NOT the application form yet. Click "Select file" or the upload area, then call upload_artifact(kind="resume"). Wait for parsing to finish. Then click Next/Continue to reach the actual form.
- File upload not working? Try: (1) browser_click the upload button/area, (2) upload_artifact with the required artifact kind. If still failing, look for a hidden file input or a "Select file" link and click that first.
- Dropdown won't fill? browser_click to open it, then browser_click the option.
- Checkbox won't check via fill_form? Use browser_click on it instead. Snapshot to verify.
- Phone field with country prefix: just type digits {phone_digits}
- Date fields: {datetime.now().strftime('%m/%d/%Y')}
- Validation errors after submit? Take BOTH snapshot AND screenshot. Snapshot shows text errors, screenshot shows red-highlighted fields. Fix all, retry.
- Honeypot fields (hidden, "leave blank"): skip them.
- Format-sensitive fields: read the placeholder text, match it exactly.
